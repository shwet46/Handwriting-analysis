    "Extraversion": "Extraverts are outgoing, enthusiastic, and sociable. They seek stimulation in the company of others and may display energetic, talkative behavior. Their handwriting often appears large and expressive.",
    "Agreeableness": "Agreeable individuals are compassionate, cooperative, and trusting. They tend to avoid conflict and are often helpful and generous. Their handwriting is often smooth, rounded, and gentle in pressure.",
    "Neuroticism": "People with high neuroticism tend to experience emotional instability, anxiety, and mood swings. Their handwriting may show variability in slant, heavy pressure, or irregular patterns due to internal tension."
